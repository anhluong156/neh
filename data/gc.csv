Yeshivas are religious institutions where individuals study the Talmud and other aspects of Jewish law and tradition. Their purpose is to produce an educated laity as well as to train rabbis and theological educators. Amazingly, these institutions have been in existence for over 2,000 years. The project has two goals: (1) to account for the survival of the yeshiva as an integral part of the Jewish community, (2) to present an accurate and detailed account of what life is like in these institutions. Participant observation, and interviewing, and analysis of existing literature will be conducted.",A Study of Rabbinical Seminaries in America and How They Have managed to Adapt and Survive in Modern Society,,,0,{},13476,1978

Under the leadership of Pennee Bender and Donna Thompson Ray of ASHP/CML, the project begins with a series of six full-day seminars on Latino/a history from the colonial period to the present. Speakers for the seminar series include Virginia Sánchez Korrol (Brooklyn College, CUNY), Andrés Reséndez (University of California at Davis), Pablo Mitchell (Oberlin College), John Nieto-Phillips (Indiana University), Orlando Hernández (Hostos Community College, CUNY), Cristina Beltrán (New York University), María Josefina Saldaña-Portillo (New York University), Ramona Hernández (City College of New York, CUNY), María Montoya (New York University), and Lisandro Pérez (John Jay College, CUNY). These seminars are supplemented by an online reading discussion series and mentoring from Queensborough faculty members Megan Elias, Aránzazu Borrachero, and Amy Traver; Carlos Hernández and Patricia Mathews-Salazar from Borough of Manhattan Community College, CUNY; and Karen Miller (LaGuardia Community College, CUNY) as participants develop and implement curricular materials. A separate program helps administrators develop strategies to support the project on their campuses. The closing conference features Vicki Ruiz of University of California at Irvine, and provide opportunities for participant teams to present on their progress. Readings are drawn from the works of the project faculty, as well as from historians Samuel Truett, Raúl Ramos, María Cristina Garcia, and Jesse Hoffnung-Garskof; anthropologist Arlene Davila; and sociologist Robert Smith, among others.",Bridging Historias through Latino History and Culture: An NEH Bridging Cultures at Community Colleges Project,,,0,"A cooperative agreement for a two-and-a-half-year faculty and curriculum development project on Latino/a history for thirty-six community college faculty and academic administrators in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.",2714,2013
